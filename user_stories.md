As a soulless marketer, I need to know how many times people clicked.
As a wretched capitalist leech, I need to know how many of those clicks were on each item.
As a gaping human void, I need that worked into a percentage so I don't have to do the math myself.

As a sucker (user), I need to have a clear representation of each thing I'm gonna click on.
As a cog, I need to not have to think too hard, and the voting process should be self-evident.

As a web developer, my code should be clearly labeled so I can go fix it when it breaks.
